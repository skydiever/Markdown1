Here is a function that uses AIC criterion to come up with a model. Select the model that has the lowest AIC value associated with it
```{r}
null = lm(Y~1, data = multi)
full = lm(Y~., data = multi)

model_selection <- function(x, model1, model2) {
  data = x
  null = model1 
  full = model2
  step(null, scope = list(lower = null, upper = full), direction = "forward")
  
  cor(data)
  
}

m1 = lm(Y~1, data = multi)
m2 = lm(Y~., data = multi)

model_selection(multi, m1,m2)
```
